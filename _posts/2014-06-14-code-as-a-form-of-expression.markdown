title:  "Code as a form of expression."

Awhile back I was having a discussion with a colleague of mine in regards to whether or not writing code can be considered a form of expression.  As a guitar player I am able to express my artistic side through song writing.  Of course, other types  of artists use different mediums to express themselves as well.  It so happens that my other favorite hobby, and profession, is software development.

While I am at work or working on a personal project I tend to approach any JavaScript that I write as literature.  I feel that this sort of approach and perspective to software development enables me to write better code and also express myself in a similar manner as any other sort of *author*.  With this perspective I can retrospectively look at the code I've written and read it like a story.  It is my hope that others who read or review my code can also take this same perspective and appreciate the effort.

{% highlight js %}
// typical approach
if (foo) {
    return bar
} else {
    return baz
}

// more stylistic approach
foo ?
  bar :
  baz
{% endhighlight %}

Unfortunately, this colleague and I do not see eye-to-eye when it comes to his topic.  His perspective is that code (or programming) is a tool and he approaches his work in that manner.  The example given was, *“If I am hired to chop down a forest, I bring an axe.”*

While I do respect his opinion, I also feel this is unfortunate and jaded away to approach your work.  I can only hope that every bit of code that I write is enjoyable and does not become something I have to do just to get a paycheck.  I feel forunate that my line of work is also my passion and that I don't feel as if I'm stuck in a dead end job staring at the clock for hours.

Albeit, he has been developing software for longer than I have, so maybe this perspective is something that comes with time.  But from my point of view, I hope to never feel that way.
